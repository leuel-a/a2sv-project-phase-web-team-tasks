# Contact Management App with React Router
## Overview
This project is a Contact Management App built using React and React Router. The main objective of this project is to gain experience in building a React application with proper routing and navigation using React Router.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. Home Page ('/'): Displays a list of contacts.
2. Contact Details ('/contacts/:id'): Displays details for a single contact.
3. Add Contact ('contact/add'): Form to add a new contact.
4. Edit Contact ('contact/edit/:id'): Form to edit an existing contact.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd contact-management-app`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server: `npm start`.

## React Router
React Router is a library that provides navigation and routing functionalities to React applications. It allows you to create different routes and define how the components should be displayed based on the current URL.

Concepts Covered
1. Routes: Define routes using the <Route> component.
2. Links: Use <Link> components to navigate between routes.
3. Outlet: Display nested components within a parent route.
4. Params: Extract URL parameters using the useParams hook.
5. Loaders: Load data dynamically using React Router's useRoutes and useMatch hooks.
6. Actions: Handle navigation actions like push, replace, and navigate.

## Learning Curve
Throughout the development of this project, I had the opportunity to learn and implement various React Router concepts. Understanding how to structure routes, create navigation links, and manage state while navigating between different parts of the application was a significant learning curve. I gained insights into utilizing route parameters to load and display specific data on different routes. Additionally, the experience of handling form submissions for creating and editing contacts while maintaining proper navigation enhanced my skills in building more complex React applications.

## Conclusion
Building the Contact Management App using React Router has been a valuable learning experience. This project has provided hands-on practice in using React Router's essential features, thereby improving my proficiency in building dynamic and navigable React applications.
