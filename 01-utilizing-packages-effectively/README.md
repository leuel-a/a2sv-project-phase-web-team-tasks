# Utilizing Packages Effectively

In this task, you need to create a new Node.js project and install the Lodash package using npm. Then, use Lodash in your project to perform some data manipulation tasks. Finally, update and delete the Lodash package to learn how to manage packages using npm.

## Instructions
1. Create a new project directory and initialize it with npm using the "npm init" command. Provide a name and description for your project, and accept the default values for the other fields.

2. Install the Lodash package using the "npm install lodash" command. Verify that Lodash is installed in the node_modules folder of your project.

3. Create a new JavaScript file in your project and require the Lodash package using the "require" statement.

4. Use Lodash to perform some data manipulation tasks, such as sorting an array, filtering an array, or finding the maximum value in an array. You can refer to the Lodash documentation for examples of how to use Lodash functions.

5. Run your JavaScript file using Node.js to verify that your code works correctly.

6. Update the Lodash package to the latest version using the "npm update lodash" command. Verify that the package has been updated to the latest version.

7. Delete the Lodash package using the "npm uninstall lodash" command. Verify that the package has been deleted from the node_modules folder of your project.

8. Experiment with different Lodash functions and try using them in your code. For example, you can try using the "chunk" function to split an array into smaller chunks, or the "debounce" function to limit the frequency of a function call.

9. Share your project with the class and ask them to review your code and provide feedback. You can also ask them to try using Lodash in their own projects and share their experiences.


## Demonstrations
```javascript
// Flattening a deeply nested array using lodash
const array = [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]]];
const flattendArray = _.flattenDeep(array);

console.log(`The flattened array "${flattendArray}", and checking if it is an array: ${Array.isArray(flattendArray).toString()}\n`);
```
