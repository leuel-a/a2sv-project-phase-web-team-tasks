# Next.js Blog Application

## Objective

The objective of this project is to gain a solid understanding of how to use Next.js to build a simple web application. This includes handling routing, fetching and displaying data, and managing state within a component-based architecture.

## App Description

The blog application allows users to create, view, and edit blog posts. Each blog post should have a title, content, and a date. The application should have the following functionality:

### Homepage

- Display a list of all blog posts with their titles and dates.
- Clicking on a blog post should navigate to its individual page.

### Individual Blog Page

- Display the title, content, and date of the selected blog post.
- Provide an option to edit the blog post's title and content.
- Save the changes made to the blog post.

### Create New Blog Page

- Provide a form to create a new blog post with fields for title and content.
- Save the newly created blog post.
